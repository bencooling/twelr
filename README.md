Twenty Eleven Overrides
Twelr deviates from it's parent theme, Twenty Eleven, in the following ways:

1. Removed unnecessary logic from the &lt;title&gt; tag output. Recommended to use yoast seo plugin for compiling page titles.
1. Most Twenty Eleven stuctural-based elements removed in favor of a layout utilising bootstrap grid.


# Gotchas
Keep in mind the following principals when working with this theme:

1. Menu items with a drop down cannot be a link, as bootstrap is mobile friendly, it only supports click (touch) events on menu items (No hover to reveal).
1. The main navigation menu needs to be configured in the Admin > Appearance > Menus to appear correctly
